- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zydec0
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code with a ground up approach. So far, I've become fairly good with LC3 assembly, and intend to move on to C fairly soon. Currently I'm working on a 2D platformer/shooter written entirely from the ground up on the LC3.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning LC3 Assembly
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the game I mentioned earlier lol.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
